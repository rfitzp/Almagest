PRAEFATIO.

Ad Ptolemaeum edendum adcessi a Bibliopola honestissimo
rogatus, nec inuitus obsecutus sum, cum id maxime
opus esse uiderem, quod praestare me posse putabam,
ut codicibus denuo collatis aestimatisque fundamentum
quoddam recensionis iaceretur. nam editio princeps
Syntaxis (Basileae 1538), ut mos erat illorum temporum,
uno nec eo bono codice nititur, et Halma, abbas Parisinus,
qui deinde solus Graecam editionem curauit (Parisiis
1813 sqq.) hodie rarissimam, ut optimum codicem Parisinum
adhibuit, ita nesque negotii critici neque sermonis
Graeci satis peritus fuit. mihi igitur incipiendum erat a
codicibus conquirendis, inspiciendis, conferendis, ubi opus
esse uisum erat. quem laborem ut per annos 1893 et
1894 profligare possem, effectum est ope et liberalitate
summi Ministerii, quod cultui scholisque Daniae
praeest, maximeque Instituti Carlsbergici, bonarum
artium in rebus angustis adminiculi locupletissimi,
cuius praesidibus hoc loco ex animi sententia maximas ago gratias.

Inspectis examinatisque codicibus, qui quidem innotuissent,
omnibus, de quibus in Prolegomenis partis posterioris agam,
hos elegi ut recensioni et utiles et sufficientes:

duabus manibus eiusdem temporis, quarum una

A1 quae a fol. 175 (p. 487, 17) incipit, sed iam in
priore parte nonnulla correxit, litteras inclinatiores habet,
iota adscriptum interdum ab A2 semper fere omittit, adcentus uero

PREFACE.

I undertook to edit Ptolemy at the request of a most honest bookseller (bibliopola), and I did so
not unwillingly, since I saw that this was a work of greatest importance and believed that I could perform it
— namely, that after collating and comparing the manuscripts anew, a certain foundation for a recension could
be laid down. For the first edition of the Syntaxis (Basel 1538), as was the custom of those times, relied
upon a single manuscript, and not even a good one; and Halma, the Parisian abbot who afterward alone oversaw
the Greek edition (at Paris, 1813 and following), rare today though it is, used what he considered the best
Parisian codex. Yet he was neither sufficiently skilled in the critical task nor sufficiently expert in the
Greek language. Therefore I had to begin with seeking out manuscripts, examining them, and comparing them
where it seemed necessary.

This work, which I was able to complete during the years 1893 and 1894, was accomplished through the help
and generosity of the Ministry of Education, which oversees the culture and schools of Denmark, and especially
of the Carlsberg Institute, an exceedingly rich source of support in difficult matters of the fine arts,
to whose presidents I here express my deepest gratitude.

Having inspected and examined all of the manuscripts that had become known to me — all of those about
which I shall speak in the later part of the Preface — I chose these as both useful and
sufficient for a recension:

A - Codex Parisinus Graecus 2389, on parchment, in folio, written in double columns in uncial letters
in the 9th century (see Omont, Inventaire II, p. 251). In letter form, as Henri Omont judges, it appears
to be Egyptian in character.

It consists of 376 leaves, of which the first relate to the end of Book XIII and are almost worn away.
Leaves 207–210, 255–270, 374–375 were supplied in the 15th century; after folio 68 four leaves are missing
(see p. 200, line 7 and p. 209, line 21), as may be gathered from the numbering of quires.

The codex was written by two excellent scribes of the same time, one of which (designated A or A2) uses very
dark ink, the other (A1) uses brownish ink; A1 begins at folio 175 (p. 487, line 17), but even in the earlier
part he has corrected some things, his letters are more inclined, he sometimes omits (where A2 has written)
the added iota, but he adds more accents and breathing marks than does A2, as the exemplar of Omont
(Facsimilés des plus anciens Manuscrits Grecs en onciale et en minuscule de la Bibliothèque Nationale, plate IX)
shows. A few corrections are due to a later hand (A3) and to a very recent hand (A4, 16th century).

I myself collated it in Paris in 1893. I have consistently neglected it in the apparatus.

B — Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1594, on parchment, from the 9th century, of which I have seen no more beautiful or
elegant copy. It consists of 284 leaves, but originally it had more; for on folio 284 is written:

“This book of the Great Syntaxis contains 315 leaves and two at the beginning of the book are missing.”

After folio 65 one leaf was lost, which a later 15th-century hand substituted with two leaves (see p. 224,
line 14 and p. 228, line 20).

The codex contains:

	•	fols. 1–8 anonymous Prolegomena to Ptolemy,
	•	fols. 9–263 Ptolemy’s Syntaxis with scholia,
	•	fols. 264–272 Ptolemy on Apparitions (of the Fixed Stars),
	•	fols. 272–276 Ptolemy on the criterion,
	•	fols. 277–276 a table of categories (folio 277 is blank),
	•	fols. 278–283 Ptolemy’s (Planetary) Hypotheses,
	•	fols. 283–284 various notes.

From folio 271 onwards, it contains two columns.

I myself investigated it and, so far as I was able, collated it in Rome in 1894. On pages 232, line 4, p. 546,
line 20, Johannes Tschiedel collated it on my behalf.

C — Codex Marcianus Graecus 313, on parchment in folio, from the 10th century, most beautifully written by an
unskilled librarian (i.e., not professional), not without many abbreviations, especially toward the end.

It has been corrected by two later hands (designated C2, 14th–15th century) and by one very recent hand
(C3, perhaps that of Halma; for it was in Paris at the beginning of this century).

It contains:

	•	fols. 1–30 Prolegomena to Ptolemy, mutilated at the beginning;
	•	fols. 30–370 Ptolemy’s Syntaxis with scholia.

It was copied from the archetype of codex B.

I myself collated it at Venice in 1893.

D — Codex Vaticanus Graecus 180, parchment, quarto, 12th century, written by several hands of the same period, at least
in part elsewhere with different pen and ink, and corrected by at least two ancient hands (D², D³) and one more recent
one (D⁴). It contains:

	•    folios 1–2:   certain astronomical notes in a recent hand;
	•    folios 3–280: Ptolemy’s Syntaxis with scholia;
	•    folio 280:    various notes by later hands;

in the lower margin: ‘altogether 277 leaves’ (it ought to be counted 278).

It is derived from an excellent and very ancient exemplar, which often agreed with codex A against B and C, and often
even alone preserved the true reading; but it had been boldly interpolated by a man skilled in the subject, either the
manuscript itself or some copy of it. For those interpolations cannot at all be attributed to the ignorant scribes of
codex D. Their errors — astonishing as they are — arising from itacism and from abbreviations wrongly understood for the
most part, I have often omitted, but never without warning the reader (see pp. 4.3; 12.20; 27.2; 29.23; cf. 40.20).
I have indicated the use of abbreviations, since they are useful for determining the age and character of the archetype.

I myself collated it at Rome, 1893–94.

E  — Codex Marcianus Graecus 310, on paper, from the 15th century.

It contains:

	•	folios 1–18    — Prolegomena to Ptolemy
	•	folios 13–151  — Ptolemy’s Syntaxis with scholia (folio 152 is blank)
	•	folios 153–261 — Theon’s commentaries on the Syntaxis (folios 262–264 are blank)
	•	folios 265–286 — other manuscrits - commentaries of Kabasilas and other works by him
	•	folios 287–288 — certain works of Barlaam

It is added ad BC (i.e., along with codices B and C).

I examined it in a few places in Venice in 1893.

F — Codex Parisinus Graecus 2390, on paper or parchment (described as bombycinus — meaning fine or luxurious,
typically paper), from the 13th century (s. XIII). See Omont, Inventaire II, p. 251.

By its style and quality it agrees with BC.

I inspected it in Paris in 1893.

Thanks to the help of these manuscripts, I am confident that the words of Ptolemy can be restored in such
a way as they would have been read by learned men in Alexandria around the year 500. I could not make use
of the interpretations and commentaries of the Arabs, and I did not wish to use the Latin ones. I have not
ventured to add my own interpretation, whether in Latin or in a more recent language, when faced with such
difficulties; let astronomers see to that if they desire an interpretation.

In the apparatus at p. 227, line 10 and p. 481, line 15, for Halma it should be placed ed. Basil. at p. 522,
line 49 the reading 6] 1/2 A1? should be deleted, for also in A it is 6, as I was made more certain by Henri
Omont afterwards. At p. 539, line 7, this note should be added: 7. “ektos I wrote, entos AʹBCD.”

In correcting the proofsheets, Henricus Menge, a friend, generously and kindly provided me with experienced
and diligent assistance.

Written at Copenhagen (Hauniae) in the month of May 1888.
